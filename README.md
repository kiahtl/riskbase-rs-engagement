# RiskBase Residents Engagement App

This is a copy project to show an initial attempt at transferring the RiskBase SPA into React. Within the codebase you can see the beginnings of several components including a Building component which contains building information, dynamically added from a mock data file.

The Buildings (plural) parent component has been added with the view in mind that there would be a place to store multiple buildings and filter through.

This is a working progress with less focus on CSS so some styling may look inaccurate and some CSS files could have improvements.

The codebase currently does not include testing due to time restrictions.

## To run the project:

- Download the repo using git clone
- Navigate to risk-base-rs-engagement

### Run command: `npm start`
